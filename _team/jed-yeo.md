## Undergraduate Student in Engineering Physics at UBC

I am a 4th year undergraduate student at the University of British Columbia majoring in Engineering Physics. I'm interested in the intersection of mathematics and computer science. Currently, I'm exploring these topics further as part of the LEAP team. My expected graduation date is Spring 2023.
