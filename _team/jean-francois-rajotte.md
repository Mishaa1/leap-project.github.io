## Resident Data Scientist at UBC [Data Science Institute](https://dsi.ubc.ca/)

I am a data science generalist, currently focusing on synthetic data and privacy especialy in healthcare. I am also involved in the [Data Science for Social Good](https://dsi.ubc.ca/data-science-social-good) program where we apply data science to interdisciplinary projects in collaboration with various partners organizations.

I started at UBC in the Fall of 2019. Before this I was a data science researcher at the Computer Research Institute of Montr√©al. Many years before, I did a PhD in particle physics at [LMU](https://www.lmu.de/en/) Munich, then a postdoc at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/lns/research/hpg.html) and another at [McGill](https://www.mcgill.ca/) University.
