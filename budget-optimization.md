## Optimizing privacy budget in differential privacy

Differential privacy gives formal and robust guarantees to prevent privacy violations that happen when computations are performed on sensitive datasets. Queries can be issued to a system and differentially private mechanisms guarantee that leakage of information will be mitigated. The problem is that if enough queries are issued, there is a risk that sensitive information may be revealed. Fortunately, privacy degrades in a controlled fashion in the differential privacy framework, and with each new query we know how much of our privacy budget was “spent”. In other words, we can set a privacy budget that puts a limit to the number of queries that can be made to the system, and with each query we know exactly how much of the budget was used. When the budget is depleted, users are not allowed to make more queries, or else we risk the the privacy of participants.

This project optimizes the use of the privacy budget so that users can extract more utility from a system providing differential privacy guarantees. We do this by implementing a smart cache, where we identify queries that a user made in the past, and return a cached result instead of computing a new answer and spending the budget. Furthermore, new queries are extrapolated from prior query results, thus consuming only a small amount of the budget.
